# Who am I?

## Hey, I'm Jason. ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a kid from South Africa, who was meant to be a loser, but fucked around on the internet and ended up doing some cool shit.

## What am I working on?

- Building and launching 12 startups in 12 months
- Proprietary crypto arbitrage trading algorithm (I've always dreamt of being a quant)
- Solving feedback loops in hybrid organisations
- A calorie tracker with image generation and modification [Counter AI: Diet & BMI Journal](https://counterai.apphttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/counter-ai-diet-bmi-journal/id6737853837?uo=2)

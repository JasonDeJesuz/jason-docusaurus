# Who am I?

Hey! I'm Jason, a software engineer passionate about building great products and sharing what I learn along the way. Currently working on making the web a better place, one commit at a time.

I love exploring new technologies and finding ways to make development more efficient and enjoyable. When I'm not coding, you can find me writing about my experiences and sharing knowledge with the community.

## My Journey

In **2023**, I launched my personal blog using Docusaurus and started sharing technical writing on various platforms. I also contributed to several open source projects, helping improve documentation and adding new features.

**2022** was a year of growth where I led the development of several key features and had the opportunity to mentor junior developers. I also spoke at local tech meetups, sharing my experiences with the community.

During **2021**, I joined an exciting startup where I dove deep into React and TypeScript. This was where I built my first production application, learning valuable lessons about scalability and maintainability along the way.
